### Pathfinder: A Graph Visualization Tool for Shortest Path Algorithms
Pathfinder is an open-source project aimed at providing a visual representation of the shortest path algorithms - A* and Dijkstra. The project is designed to help students, researchers, and developers understand the working of these algorithms and implement them in their projects.

### Motivation
Shortest path algorithms like A* and Dijkstra are widely used in various fields, including computer science, logistics, transportation, and many more. However, understanding the working of these algorithms can be challenging, especially for beginners. Pathfinder aims to bridge this gap by providing a visual representation of these algorithms.

The motivation behind this project is to make learning and implementing these algorithms easy and accessible for everyone. By providing an interactive and visual representation of these algorithms, Pathfinder simplifies the understanding of complex algorithms and makes learning fun.

### Features
Pathfinder provides the following features:

Visual representation of A* and Dijkstra algorithms.
Option to set the start and end nodes and obstacles.
Real-time updates of the algorithm as it runs.
Detailed explanation of the algorithm and its working.
Tech Stack

Pathfinder is an excellent tool for anyone interested in learning or implementing the A* and Dijkstra algorithms. Its interactive and visual representation simplifies the understanding of these algorithms and makes learning fun. We hope that Pathfinder will help students, researchers, and developers to explore the world of shortest path algorithms and inspire them to create innovative solutions using these algorithms.
